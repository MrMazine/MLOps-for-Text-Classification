# DVC Text Classification Pipeline

A complete MLOps pipeline for text classification with Data Version Control (DVC) and memory-optimized data loading.

## Overview

This project implements a robust data versioning and preprocessing system for text classification tasks, focusing on:

- Data versioning with DVC
- Memory-efficient data loading via generators and iterators
- Text preprocessing pipeline for NLP tasks
- Integration with remote storage
- Modular design for easy integration with model training
